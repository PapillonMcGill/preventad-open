# PREVENT-AD open Dataset

### Overview

PREVENT-Alzheimer means Pre-symptomatic evaluation of experimental or novel treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. The PREVENT-Alzheimer program is the principal clinical research activity of the Centre for Studies on Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease, or  StoP-AD Centre. The goal of this program is to study memory and brain changes in healthy people over the age of 55. While some people in this age group begin to develop apparent memory problems, many more may have undetected brain changes that mark the very beginning of the disease long before the onset of symptoms.
With rapid advances in technology, such as high-resolution brain scanning methods or the precise examination of brain chemicals, we can now detect early evidence of brain changes. What’s more, we can likely track these changes over time. These brain changes are more likely to occur in individuals who have had either a parent or sibling affected by AD. This is why we require that our participants have a close family member affected by the disease.
